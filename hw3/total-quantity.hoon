:: The lab needs to know the total quantity of reagent (in grams) you've been able to produce in the past week.  
:: Each day's total may be calculated by taking the day number times itself.  (E.g. on day three 3Ã—3=9 grams were produced.  The reaction is reset every Monday.) 
::  Write a trap to add up the seven values.
