:: A prime number is a number which is only divisible by itself and one (it has no factors), such as 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.
::  Write a gate named ++primes which produces the Euler primes as a list.  The Euler primes are given by kÂ²-k+n (for k = 1 to n-1). 
:: (Note:  Your program will produce a set of primes if given one of "Euler's lucky numbers": 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 17, or 41.)
